# Rework to integrate the Religious Leagues
# R'Hllor should appear and gain ground via the event below
# At 25% of all Lords being R'Hllor, a crisis emerges and the leagues start

# A Fiery Temptress
# The Lord of Light, or R'hllor is a popular god in the Free Cities of Essos. A dualistic view on the world, those who worship R'hllor beleive him to be the god of light, heat and life, with his antithesis being the Great Other, the god of ice and death. Locked in an eternal struggle over the fate of the world, it is told that once Azor Ahai rises, wielding the flaming sword Lightbringer, only then will their struggle end.

# Tolerate their prescence, but do not endorse their practices
