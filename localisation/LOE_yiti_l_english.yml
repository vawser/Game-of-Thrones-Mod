During the last two years of the struggle, the rival clans of the Jogos Nhai united against Lo Bu under a woman called Zhea, whose riders eventually descended upon Lo Bu's host, slaughtering them all. Lo Bu was among those slain. Zhea had his head stripped of its flesh and his skull dipped in gold, so it cou  ld serve as her drinking cup. Every jhattar of the Jogos Nhai since Zhea has drunk fermented zorse milk from Lo Bu's skull.\n\nNow that we occupy the vile hordes, we have received reports from our officers that they heard the locals talk about the fabled §OGolden Skull§!.
