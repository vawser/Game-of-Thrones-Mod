 got_renowned_name_reform_desc: "Men who understand how the world works do not sit idly by and hope that 'fate' will come by and bring them riches and glory. Fame must be earned, respect must be earned, power must be earned. The greatest of houses understand this power dynamic, carving their path towards greatness through sheer will."
 got_renowed_name_tt: "At least §Y2§! §YMonarchies§! with our dynasty"
 
 got_righteous_rulers_reform: "Righteous Rulers"
 got_righteous_rulers_reform_desc: "Honor is one of the most important trait any man or woman can have. A cold heart invites dissent from even the most loyal companions, and can result in rebel uprisings. A warm heart, while not appealing to strong-willed characters, can buy the loyalty of your fiercest enemies."
 
 got_natural_schemers_reform: "Natural Schemers"
 got_natural_schemers_reform_desc: "When a general wants a thing done, he sends his armies. When a politican wants a thing done, he sends his spies. The world of politics is a dangerous game for those who are unprepared for the intrigue and treachery of the real world. We must ensure our survival, no matter the means."
 mechanic_can_use_assassinations_yes: "Enables the use of the §YAssassination§! espionage action, allowing you to kill landed rulers."
 
 got_blood_of_old_valyria_reform: "Blood of Old Valyria"
 got_blood_of_old_valyria_reform_desc: "Our lineage descends from the great families of Valyria, who once dominated western Essos before the Doom of Valyria. Though the Valyrian Freehold is long gone, Valyrians can still easily rise again to dominate Westeros and beyond."
 
 #
 
 got_expand_administrative_arm_reform: "Expand the Administrative Arm"
 got_expand_administrative_arm_reform_desc: "Tradition dictates that the lord of a realm must always rely upon the nobility and powerful local figures to uphold the law of the land. But tradition does not govern the people, it only guides them. The law is what we say it is, and we will enforce it with our own appointed governors and officers."
 mechanic_unlock_more_state_edicts_yes: "Enables several restricted §YState Edicts§!:\n- §YCentralize the State§!: §G-0.05§! Monthly Autonomy Change\n- §YEnforce Religious Unity§!: §G+1.0%§! Local Missionary Strength\n- §YArmy Enlistment Campaign§!: §G+25.0%§! Local Manpower Modifier & §G-10.0%§! Local Recruitment Time\n- §YNaval Enlistment Campaign§!: §G+25.0%§! Local Sailors Modifier & §G-10.0%§! Local Shipbuilding Time"

 got_maintain_status_quo_reform: "Maintain the Status Quo"
 got_maintain_status_quo_reform_desc: "Often the rich and powerful of our realm, primarily the nobility, raise concern that power in our domain is too centralized and more responsibilities should be delegated to those individuals. Still others insist that our reach does not extend far enough as is our perceived right. Maintaining the balance of power between our House and the various ambitious parties is necessary for the stability of our reign."

 got_decentralize_power_reform: "Decentralize our Authority"
 got_decentralize_power_reform_desc: "No autocratic regime manages to stay afloat for very long. Eventually, Kings and high Lords come to rely upon lesser lords and powerful local officers to maintain the stability of their domain. It's high time to expand upon the privileges of our lesser lords to ensure we can rely upon them in our time of need."
 mechanic_dynasty_base_privileges_yes: "Enables §YPrivileges§! for the §YNobility§!, §YClergy§!, and §YMerchants§! that provide greater benefits when compared to the existing basic privileges."
 got_doa_active_privilege_tt: "Enacted §YDecentralize our Authority§! reform."
 
 #
 
 got_reinforce_the_seven_kingdoms_reform: "Reinforce the Seven Kingdoms"
 got_reinforce_the_seven_kingdoms_reform_desc: "The very concept of the Seven Kingdoms relies upon a strong foundation with our subject nations. The unique relationship that exists between the Royal House and the many Great Houses keeps the integrity of the realm intact. To reinforce this relationship would mean strengthening our Royal Subjects at the cost of the Crown's own power. In circumstances such as these, however, our subjects could do more good than harm for the realm as a whole."
 
 got_reaffirm_the_one_kingdom_reform: "Assert the One Kingdom"
 got_reaffirm_the_one_kingdom_reform_desc: "Since the early days of Aegon the Conqueror, the Seven Kingdoms has functioned as a successful feudal monarchy. Generations of monarchs have come and gone, all the while the Great Houses of Westeros have grown in strength. The concept of a single autocratic regime may seem foreign to the loosely united nobles of Westeros, and no doubt taking steps towards an autocratic society under one house will destablize the realm as a whole. Regardless, we must do what is necessary to secure our reign."
 
 got_steady_as_she_goes_reform: "Steady As She Goes"
 got_steady_as_she_goes_reform_desc: "For generations, our house has survived by simply staying out of the major conflicts and focusing on our own development. There's nothing wrong with continuing this policy of pseudo-isolationism, though we should keep our enemies at bay."

 got_expansionism_reform: "Pursue Expansionist Agenda"
 got_expansionism_reform_desc: "We have achieved all we can in the limited, tedious diplomatic maneuvers we've been making for generations. It's time we change our attitude and pursue an expansionist policy towards our neighbors. What we have not peacefully acquired must be forcefully taken."
 mechanic_call_feudatories_to_war_yes: "§YFeudatories§! can be called into your wars at the cost of Liberty Desire and their opinion of us."

 got_maintain_strong_alliances_reform: "Forge Steadfast Alliances"
 got_maintain_strong_alliances_reform_desc: "History has shown us that great leaders can rise to prominence and conquer opposing empires. Such leaders are never alone, however, and are often supported by loyal neighboring allies. Alliances can make or break a realm, and it should be our primary duty to ensure our alliances can stand the test of time and the nobles we've come to entrust do not become turncoats in our time of need."

 got_strengthen_our_feudatories_reform: "Strengthen Feudatories"
 got_strengthen_our_feudatories_reform_desc: "Our power stems from the support of our subject lords. To ensure their cooperation and continuing support, we will lower their feudal obligations to us to support their developing local economies."

 #

 got_standing_army_reform: "Raise Permanent Armies"
 got_standing_army_reform_desc: "The most significant component of any powerful realm is the military, specifically the army. No empire can stand the test of time if it cannot raise a professional force to defend its borders. The only thing standing in the road to a permanent army are our most powerful nobles, who may feel threatened by the existence of a large army in control by their overlord."
 got_standing_army_reform_tt: "§GThis reform compensates for the Land Forcelimit penalty from the base form §YDynasty Mechanic§! §R(-25.0%)§!.§!"
 got_25_dev_of_subjects_min_tt: "Development at least §Y25%§! of §YSubjects' development§!."
 got_25_dev_of_subjects_max_tt: "Development at most §Y25%§! of §YSubjects' development§!."

 got_rely_on_levies_reform: "Rely on Levy Forces"
 got_rely_on_levies_reform_desc: "For generations, our forces have been mainly supplied by the noble lords who swear fealty to us. With the signficant amount of land being controlled by these lords, fielding levy armies is not such a terrible idea and will ensure that our noble vassals remain loyal to us for more generations to come. Those who stand in the way of our realm will feel the full force our vassal armies on the battlefield."
 
 got_naval_supremacy_reform: "Dominate the Coastal Waters"
 got_naval_supremacy_reform_desc: "While it may be an overlooked aspect of the realm, the navy can serve a great purpose for mighty coastal powers. The open sea provides us with an great opportunity to outmaneuver and flank any opposing force by navigating the coastal waters. It may even be necessary to prevent the enemy from attempting such a tactic against us as well, giving us another solid reason to raise a fleet of warships."
 got_naval_supremacy_reform_tt: "§GThis reform compensates for the Naval Forcelimit penalty from the base form §YDynasty Mechanic§! §R(-50.0%)§!.§!"
 
 #
 
 got_the_one_true_faith_reform: "The One True Faith"
 got_the_one_true_faith_reform_desc: "It is the sacred duty of all House members to ensure that our religion is dominant to the rest. To that end, we must seek out and destroy all heretics or forcibly convert them to our way of life to please the gods."
 
 got_strengthen_clergy_reform: "Increase Clerical Rights"
 got_strengthen_clergy_reform_desc: "For centuries, the church brought purpose to the peasants of the realm. In their times of despair, it was faith that brought them back to the fields for another day. Expanding the rights of the clergy will only make it easier for them to execute their holy tasks and help to keep the peasantry in line."

 got_preserve_the_priestdom_reform: "Preserve the Priestdom"
 got_preserve_the_priestdom_reform_desc: "The clerical ministers in our sphere have helped to ensure the stability of the realm and continuing prosperity of our many cities and farmtowns. They have been a powerful asset to our family for generations with little interference on our behalf. It's best to keep things to way they've been."
 
 got_slacken_clergy_authority_reform: "Slacken the Clergy's Authority"
 got_slacken_clergy_authority_reform_desc: "The influence clerical ministers hold over the people is great and could possibly be seen as a risk to our own power base should the church authorities in our realm disapprove of our governance. Ensuring they cannot stand in the way of progress will guarantee our safety."
 
 #
 
 got_empower_the_merchant_class_reform: "Empower the Merchant Class"
 got_empower_the_merchant_class_reform_desc: "It's due to the merchants and traders in our sphere of influence that we have an economy. They ensure that a constant stream of money finds its way into our state. To empower their privileges and their influence leads to a faster accumulation of our wealth."
 
 got_curtail_the_trading_guilds_reform: "Curtail the Trading Guilds"
 got_curtail_the_trading_guilds_reform_desc: "The rights and privileges of the merchantry have been too vast for far too long. Wars and expansion of the state are confronted by a lack of support from our own class of merchants. It is time to curtail the rights of the traders and create a centralized hierarchy."

 got_introduce_regulatory_economics_reform: "Regulate Local Economy"
 got_introduce_regulatory_economics_reform_desc: "The economy of the state has stayed afloat and, from time to time, even thrived on its own. There has been little need for intervention, however, the economy hasn't always suited our needs. We will have to take command of the economy in our sphere of influence to yield the benefits we desire."
 
 got_develop_the_pastures_reform: "Develop the Pasturelands"
 got_develop_the_pastures_reform_desc: "A great percentage of the land in our domain is filled with undeveloped pastures which have the potential to be transformed into urban powerhouses. Our resources should be invested in improving and developing the land we already own."
 mechanic_cheaper_developing_pastures_yes: "Provinces with §YFarmlands§! & §YGrasslands§! terrain will have an additional §G-5.0%§! Local Development Cost."

 got_subsidize_the_goldmines: "Subsidize the Goldmines"
 got_subsidize_the_goldmines_desc: "Everyone knows that gold is very valuable and an easy means to gain massive wealth. Gold can be found in small quantities scattered in rivers, but the biggest source of gold is found underground. To effectively exploit this, expensive gold mines must be made. Our prioritization should be the gold mines first."
 
 #
 
 got_strength_through_the_nobles_reform: "Strength through the Lords"
 got_strength_through_the_nobles_reform_desc: "The power in the realms of men is derived from the nobility, as a majority of the land is governed by lesser lords and their servants. They've lived in comfort for generations behind their castles and ensured the stability in their sphere of control. As their liege-lord, we must protect their rights for the benefit of the realm."

 got_strength_through_the_gods_reform: "Strength through the Gods"
 got_strength_through_the_gods_reform_desc: "Clerical ministers serve the realm in a different manner; they provide the necessary guidance to both nobles and commoners alike. Faith in our religion has brought miracles to life, often perceived to be scientifically impossible. As their liege-lord, we must protect their rights for the benefit of the realm."

 got_strength_through_the_merchants_reform: "Strength through the Merchants"
 got_strength_through_the_merchants_reform_desc: "The merchantry has existed since the concept of society. Trading is a major part of daily life and supports people from all social standings, us included. As their liege-lord, we must protect their rights for the benefit of the realm."

 got_strength_through_the_people_reform: "Strength through the People"
 got_strength_through_the_people_reform_desc: "While the commoners have often been overlooked and are frequently mistreated by those superior to them, they make up a majority of the population. Positioning ourselves as a metaphorical 'Lord of the People', we can ensure the loyalty of our people and gives us the opportunity to circumvent powerful rivals in our realm. As their liege-lord, we must protect their rights for the benefit of the realm."

 got_lord_of_lords_reform: "Lord of Lords"
 got_lord_of_lords_reform_desc: "PLACEHOLDER"

 got_lord_of_the_people_reform: "Lord of the People"
 got_lord_of_the_people_reform_desc: "PLACEHOLDER"

 got_the_kings_peace_reform: "Reassert the King's Peace"
 got_the_kings_peace_reform_desc: "The concept of the 'King's Peace' has maintained the continued stability of the realm since Aegon the Conqueror first introduced it after the Conquest. The threat of being branded a traitor has successfully swayed many generations of nobles from resolving disputes on the battlefield and has strengthened both the Crown and the local lords."
 mechanic_has_the_kings_peace_yes: "All §YFeudatory§! subject nations in the Seven Kingdoms will have §YLiberty Desire§! reduced by §G10.00%§!."

 got_declare_autocratic_state_reform: "Declare Autocratic State"
 got_declare_autocratic_state_reform_desc: "The power dynamic in our realm doesn't offer us enough control, we must seize power from our nobles and declare a centralized autocratic monarchy."
 
 got_adopt_republican_ideals_reform: "Adopt Elective Government"
 got_adopt_republican_ideals_reform_desc: "For far too long, we have ignored the wishes of our subject lords and peasants. Adopting an Essos-style republican government will benefit everyone, not just our house."

 #

 got_rule_by_noble_decree_reform: "Rule by Noble Decree"
 got_rule_by_noble_decree_reform_desc: "In the feudal hierarchy, the Lord reigns supreme and only answers to their liege and the gods. In essence, the Lord executes the will of the their liege and must do so without pushback from his own nobles. If our own nobles prevent us from maintaining order, we may strain our relations with our liege."
 
 got_council_of_lords_reform: "Institute Council of Lords"
 got_council_of_lords_reform_desc: "The interests of our subject lords often coincide with the interests of our realm as a whole. It is, therefore, not surprising that many lords remain loyal to our cause and ensure the integrity of the realm is not disturbed. Their support should come in some official manner, one that can even act on our behalf."

 got_rule_by_royal_decree_reform: "Rule by Royal Decree"
 got_rule_by_royal_decree_reform_desc: "In the feudal hierarchy, the King reigns supreme and only gods stand above him. This knowledge has been lost and, in practice, the King is expected to satisfy the needs of their lesser lords. The desires of the monarch must now be placed first and our lords second."

 got_empower_small_council_reform: "Institutionalize the Small Council"
 got_empower_small_council_reform_desc: "Since its humble beginnings with Aegon the Conqueror, the Small Council has served the monarch faithfully for more than a dozens King in succession. They have never failed to execute the King's orders, and have proven to be more than capable in administering the realm in the King's absence."

 got_invoke_an_elective_succession_reform: "Invoke an Elective Succession"
 got_invoke_an_elective_succession_reform_desc: "The traditional succession law of our dynasty ensures that the realm remains unified and under the leadership of our line. However, some of our subject lords wish to have a greater level of influence over the succession of the liege realm. Afterall, our power comes from the loyalty of our vassals. To compromise, an Elective Succession can be established.\n\nThe frequency of the election is dependent on which faction is in power, the Nobles or the Dynasts, and the direction of the realm can greatly differ depending on which faction is in power."

 got_quash_noble_power_reform: "Curtail Noble Privileges"
 got_quash_noble_power_reform_desc: "As the state grows it is becoming more and more apparent that the old noble families have too much influence and power. Their jealous concern for their old privileges is greatly hindering the growth of our government."
 
 got_enforce_trader_privileges_reform: "Enforce Trader Privileges"
 got_enforce_trader_privileges_reform_desc: "By strengthening the ties between the state and successful merchant enterprises, we can increase our reach out into the world as well as the profit we bring home."
 
 got_grant_noble_castle_rights_reform: "Grant Noble Castle Rights"
 got_grant_noble_castle_rights_reform_desc: "The Nobility of our country is in direct competition with the Crown for the ownership of the lands. By granting the Nobility the rights to own their own castles and villages around it, we can ease the conflicts between the monarchy and the nobles."
 
 #got_maintain_nobles_status_quo_reform: "Compromise with the Nobility"
 #got_maintain_nobles_status_quo_reform_desc: "The balance of power within our state between the estates and the Crown is a delicate matter. Our best decision is to keep this balance intact by neither cartering more privileges for the noble class nor curtailing its power."
 
 got_volantene_traders_reform: "Strengthen Volantene Traders"
 got_volantene_traders_reform_desc: "While Volantis and the Rhoyne are rich lands, the estuary has always attracted traders and acted, above all else, as the port to Essos. This land was taken with sword in hand but ship owners and traders are as influential and as vital to our state as noble officers."
 
 got_red_syncretism_reform: "Red Syncretism"
 got_red_syncretism_reform_desc: "The most popular disciples of R'hllor in this foreign land have always been the red priests. They incorporate parts of the local traditions and take an active part in the daily life of the local population. Many of them have taken on the role of local leaders and, if we support them, we may see their communities grow as they reclaim land from jungles and swamps to build new cities."
 
 got_yitish_nobles_reform: "Empower the Yitish"
 got_yitish_nobles_reform_desc: "Our lands are full of smaller local tribes and clans that we could put to good use if we gave them a place within the system of our state. As a class these Yitish officials could serve as police, builders of fortifications, local representatives and military officers. Most of all they could mobilize their kinsmen and provide us with a good source of able men."
 
 got_strength_of_the_ghiscari_reform: "Strength of the Ghiscari"
 got_strength_of_the_ghiscari_reform_desc: "With the Ghiscari people united behind us there is little we could not do.\nWe cannot however become the oppressors we have once fought, all will be able to rise to power within our state."
 
 got_hyrkooni_society_reform: "Hyrkooni Elites"
 got_hyrkooni_society_reform_desc: "Hyrkoon was once conquered by Yitish states and our ancestors were reliant on immigration to be able to staff and maintain their state. Over time this has created a cosmopolitan state of newcomers, second generation Hyrkooni and old Yitish aristocrats."
 
 got_kingsguard_reform: "Formalized Kingsguard"

 got_centralize_empire_reform_desc: "The vast lands under our jurisdiction span from east to west. We must ensure the smooth operation of our provinces under our imperial domain."
 
 got_decentralize_reform: "Decentralized Crownlands"
 got_decentralize_reform_desc: "The expansion of the Crownlands comes with a need to reform our way of administrating the provinces under our authority. While the traditional method of governance has proved effective in the past, our personal domain stretches too far and too wide to rely solely upon the monarch.
