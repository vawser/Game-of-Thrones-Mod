 got_expand_administrative_arm_reform: "Expand the Administrative Arm"
 got_expand_administrative_arm_reform_desc: "Tradition dictates that the Lord of the realm always rely upon the nobility and powerful local figures to uphold the law of the land. But tradition does not govern the people, it only guides them. The law is what we say it is and we will enforce it with our own appointed governors and officers."

 got_maintain_status_quo_reform: "Maintain the Status Quo"
 got_maintain_status_quo_reform_desc: "Often the rich and powerful of our realm, primarily the nobility, raise concern that power in our domain is too centralized and more responsibilities should be delegated to those individuals. Still others insist that our reach does not extend far enough as is our perceived right. Maintaining the balance of power between our House and the various ambitious parties is key for the stability of our reign."
 
 got_decentralize_power_reform: "Decentralize our Authority"
 got_decentralize_power_reform_desc: "No autocratic regime manages to stay afloat for very long. Eventually, Kings and high Lords come to rely upon lesser lords and powerful local officers to maintain the stability of their domain. It's high time to expand upon the privileges of our lesser lords to ensure we can rely upon them in our time of need."

 got_reinforce_the_seven_kingdoms_reform_desc: "The very concept of the Seven Kingdoms relies upon a strong foundation with our subject nations. The unique relationship that exists between the Royal House and the many Great Houses keeps the integrity of the realm intact. To reinforce this relationship would mean strengthening our Royal Subjects at the cost of the Crown's own power. In circumstances such as these, however, our subjects could do more good than harm for the realm as a whole."
 
 got_reaffirm_the_one_kingdom_reform: "Assert the One Kingdom"
 got_reaffirm_the_one_kingdom_reform_desc: "Since the early days of Aegon the Conqueror, the Seven Kingdoms has functioned as a successful feudal monarchy. Generations of monarchs have come and gone, all the while the Great Houses of Westeros have grown in strength. The concept of a single autocratic regime may seem foreign to the loosely united nobles of Westeros, and no doubt taking steps towards an autocratic society under one house will destablize the realm as a whole. Regardless, we must do what is necessary to secure our reign."

 got_volantene_traders_reform_desc: "While Volantis and the Rhoyne are rich lands, the estuary has always attracted traders and acted, above all else, as the port to Essos. This land was taken with sword in hand but ship owners and traders are as influential and as vital to our state as noble officers."
 
 got_red_syncretism_reform: "Red Syncretism"
 got_red_syncretism_reform_desc: "The most popular disciples of R'hllor in this foreign land have always been the red priests. They incorporate parts of the local traditions and take an active part in the daily life of the local population. Many of them have taken on the role of local leaders and, if we support them, we may see their communities grow as they reclaim land from jungles and swamps to build new cities."

 got_yitish_nobles_reform_desc: "Our lands are full of smaller local tribes and clans that we could put to good use if we gave them a place within the system of our state.

 got_decentralize_reform: "Decentralized Crownlands"
 got_decentralize_reform_desc: "The expansion of the Crownlands comes with a need to reform our way of administrating the provinces under our authority. While the traditional method of governance has proved effective in the past, our personal domain stretches too far and too wide to rely solely upon the monarch. Setting up local independent administrators and governors will ease the burden and allow us to extend our personal domain even further."
 
 got_westerosi_recruitment: "Westerosi Recruitment"
 got_westerosi_recruitment_desc: "Over time it has become evermore clear that we cannot trust either our conflict prone governors or the local land holders. If we are to acquire officials and commanders we can trust we must look to recruit westerosi nobles to fill these positions instead."
 
 got_jade_signet_reform: "Jade Signet System"
 got_jade_signet_reform_desc: "Our empire requires loyal and able servants. Let us reforge our noble class according to a numerical system. Each noble will be given a rank, corresponding to both his obligation and will then be assigned lands around the empire by our administration to support him in accordance with his rank. The guiding principle for how highly someone is ranked must be ability, and this route must be open regardless of religion or origin. Only this way can we be sure to raise a court of those most able to bring our empire forward."
 
 got_clergy_in_administration_reform: "Administrative Clergy"
 got_clergy_in_administration_reform_desc: "The clergy already possess many of the skills we look for in administrators. They are well educated, experienced scribes and they have a higher calling.

 got_of_noble_bearing_reform: "Nobles of the Robe"
 got_of_noble_bearing_reform_desc: "The noble families of the realm have sworn to provide not only council but also eternal loyalty to our monarch. As our realm expands it is clear that these duties cannot be solely performed by serving us with sword in hand.

 got_meritocratic_focus_reform: "Meritocratic Recruitment"
 got_meritocratic_focus_reform_desc: "We cannot let old privileges govern who will get the privilege of serving our kingdom as it grows.
