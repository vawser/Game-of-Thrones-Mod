 string_start_yiti: "After the collapse of the §YGreat Empire of the Dawn§!, the §YEmpire of Yi Ti§! began. Since the end of the §YLong Night§! eleven dynasties of emperors have ruled over Yi Ti, each known by a color honorific. The transitions of power between dynasties did not always occur peacefully, and led to a prolonged period of §Ycivil war§! and anarchy. The longest of these lasted more than a hundred years.\n\nUnder the sea-green emperors, Yi Ti reached the apex of its power having §Yconquered Leng§! and §Yexacting tribute§! from Qarth, Old Ghis, Asshai, and other lands.\n\nDuring the past two thousand years, Yi Ti has often §Yfought against raiders§! of the Jogos Nhai. Many §Ygod-emperors§! invaded the Plains of the Jogos Nhai, but these attacks usually did not end well, as the Jogos Nhai would usually evade capture for such long periods of time that the Yitish invaders would give up and go home.\n\nIn the present day, Yi Ti is ruled from Yin by the seventeenth azure emperor, §YBu Gai§!. However, the amount of power he has is §Yweak§! compared to older god-emperors, and the local governors and tax-collectors have carved out a hundred princedoms among the provinces. In §YCarcosa§!, on the Hidden Sea, an exiled sorcerer lord resides, who claims to be the §Y69th Yellow Emperor§!. In addition, a general called Pol Qo has named himself the first of the §YOrange Emperors§!, using Trader Town as his capital."

 string_start_jogos: "The §YJogos Nhai§! are §Ynomadic people§! who live in yurts, tents, and saddles. They are renowned for their §Yriding of zorses§!, a horse like species, with black and white stripes. Legend claims the Jogos Nhai, led by their §Yjhattar§! - the jhat of jhats and §Ywar leader§! of all their people - Gharak Squint-Eye, slew the last of the Jhogwin (stone giants twice as large as westerosi giants), at the Battle of Howling Hills.\n\nTo the east, the Jogos Nhai carried out §Yconstant attacks§! upon §YN'Ghai§!, reducing the once proud kingdom to a single city, §YNefer§!.\n\nPrior to the Dry Times, to the west, the Jogos Nhai were also involved in a bloody §Yborder war§! with the §YPatrimony of Hyrkoon§! that saw the zorse-riders poisoning rivers and wells, burning down towns and cities, and carrying off thousand Hyrkoon into slavery. The enmity between the zorse-riders and the warrior women of the Bone Mountains runs deep into the present, and over the centuries dozens of jhattars have led armies up the Steel Road and broken against the walls of Kayakayanaya. Nevertheless, the moonsingers sing of the §Yglorious day§! when the Jogos Nhai will prevail over the remnants of Hyrkoon and §Yspill over§! the mountains to claim the fertile lands beyond.\n\nTo the south, even the §YGolden Empire of Yi Ti§! have been target of the Jogos Nhai depredations. §YRaids§! into the empire are a §Yway of life§! for the zorse-riders, and a source of the gold and gems that decor the arms and necks of moonsingers and jhats as well as of the slaves that serve them and tend their herds. Over the past two thousand years, YiTish cities, towns, farms, and fields beyond count have been reduced to ruins and ashes. Many imperial generals and three God-Emperors have led armies to bring the nomads to heel but have seldom ended well."

 string_start_nefer: "Nefer, referred to by travelers as the §YSecret City§!, is the capital of §YN'ghai§!, and is the kingdom's last remaining city. It lies at the §Yedge of the known world§!, a prosperous port city, a bastion of civilisation among the savages.\n\nOr, that was the case until a few decades ago. All that changed with the §Yinvasion of the Jogos Nhai§! who brought with them misery and destruction.\n\nNow, Nefer enjoys a sinister reputation as a §Yhaunt of necromancers and torturers§!. They took power after the invasions in hopes they would defend the city and the last of the Neferi people, leaded by a Grand Cultist and his family, said to be reincarnations of the same person.\n\nShrouded by fog, Nefer is surrounded by tall chalk cliffs. When seen from the harbor, it appears to be no more than a small town. Nine-tenths of Nefer is said to be §Ybeneath underground§!, however, giving the city its nickname of the Secret City, as to protect it against foes, and hide it's black secrets."
