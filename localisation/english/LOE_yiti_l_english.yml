 yiti.15.t: "The §OGolden Skull§!"
 yiti.15.d: "Many eons ago, Lo Bu, the 43rd Scarlet Emperor assembled a mighty host, supposedly of three hundred thousand men, and led his force into the Jogos Nhai plains, leaving a burning wasteland behind everywhere he went. During his campaign, millions of Jogos Nhai were killed. During the last two years of the struggle, the rival clans of the Jogos Nhai united against Lo Bu under a woman called Zhea, whose riders eventually descended upon Lo Bu's host, slaughtering them all. Lo Bu was among those slain. Zhea had his head stripped of its flesh and his skull dipped in gold, so it cou  ld serve as her drinking cup. Every jhattar of the Jogos Nhai since Zhea has drunk fermented zorse milk from Lo Bu's skull.\n\nNow that we occupy the vile hordes, we have received reports from our officers that they heard the locals talk about the fabled §OGolden Skull§!.

 yiti.19.t: "Rest in pain"
 yiti.19.d: "Using the insights of Ku Per, we have determined that that the rider with the §OGolden Skull§! now resides in [loe_owns_golden_skull.Capital.GetCapitalName].

 yiti.21.t: "The One-Armed man"

 yiti.23.t: "Realisation time"
 yiti.23.d: "The hired assassin made his way to the imperial court in order to present the long desired §OGolden Skull§!. As he approaches the throne, [Root.Monarch.GetName] notices something strange. The man in front of him, has only one arm! In an instant, the assassin pulls out his blade and makes quick work of the emperor's several bodyguards. He then proceeds to lower his hood and reveal his pointed skull, a typical Jogos Nhai trait. He is the rider you sent the assassins after."
