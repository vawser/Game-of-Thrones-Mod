 feudal_structure: "Feudal Structure"
 desc_feudal_structure: "Since man first roamed the world, a power structure has existed to keep society from collapsing. The feudal structure, while not the most fair societal system, kept the strongest in power and allowed for certain families to gain a foothold over large swathes of land. Subject lords would be placed in power to maintain the law of the land and ensure order was maintained among the general populace under their rule."

 crop_rotation: "Crop Rotation"
 desc_crop_rotation: "Growing the same crop in the same place for many years in a row, known as monocropping, gradually depletes the soil of certain nutrients and selects for both a highly competitive pest and weed community. Without balancing nutrient use and diversifying pest and weed communities, the productivity of monocultures is highly dependent on external inputs that may be harmful to the soils fertility. Conversely, a well-designed crop rotation can reduce the need for synthetic fertilizers and herbicides by better using ecosystem services from a diverse set of crops."

Merchants from as far as the Empire of the Yi Ti now make it to great cities of King's Landing and Oldtown, allowing for a greater exchange of goods and ideas. The age of global trade is at our doorstep, and we must embrace it if we're too enrich our coffers."

 desc_manufacturing: "With heavy influence from religious principles, discoveries in the scientific field was limited. People relied on the workmanship of artisan to provide them the amenities they desired, often having to wait a significant amount of time and costing them a fortune. The use of large engineered machinery allowed for people to ease their workload and bypassing ancient restrictive guild laws by creating manufactories outside city limites allowed for the mass production of any type of goods."

 # Events
 mastery_events.1.title: "Era of High Engineering"
 mastery_events.1.desc: "Up until the last decade, engineering projects were physically limited in scale. Political leaders were inclined on using slave labor or simply paying experienced builders to engineer whatever it was they required. This undoubtably slowed down technological advancements, though in recent years a remarkable group of designers have pioneered several new pieces of machinery and public works which are soon to be adopted world-wide for the betterment of mankind.\n\nNow that we've reached new heights in mechanical engineering, the world can expect to see great sight-seeing marvels throughout all of Westeros and Essos. But while this may be a good thing for the known world's economic centers, several militarists are attempting to revolutionize siegeworks and are creating machines of war capable of immense devastation by "borrowing" several of the new designs."
 mastery_events.12.desc: "Rumors have reached our leadership about the invention of highly sophisticated engineering marvels. They're believed to help one man do the same work as ten people in just half the amount of time."
 mastery_events.1.option.a: "This changes everything..."
 mastery_events.1.tt: "§YEmbracing§! the §YHigh Engineering§! Mastery will be vital for future advancements in §YTechnology§!."

 mastery_events.2.title: "Dawn of World Trade"
 mastery_events.2.desc: "Goods have been moved across continents since antiquity. But where this was previously limited to a set number of routes and goods such as the manufactured goods of Westeros making it no further than the Free Cities of Essos, all trade is now increasingly becoming part of a greater world network. Despite most trade having been done in-land across the continent, new sea routes have been charted all the way from the capital of the Yitish society to the great city of Braavos\n\nNever-before-seen silks from the eastern part of the world have made their way to the western portion of the world. The nobility of Westeros and banking oligarchs of the Free Cities are able to dawn new clothing to show their off their newfound wealth. Ironwood, previously only found in the northern half of Westeros, has now made its way to the far eastern countries."
 mastery_events.22.desc: "Our long distance trade contacts have begun to produce more and more exotic goods for our markets. They claim it is because their contacts with other lands have in turn increased from a few times a year to an almost constant contact with various trade networks and firms. Some have even offered to invest in their coming deliveries, something they claim is a common custom in their far-away homelands."

 mastery_events.3.title: "Discovery of the Printing Press"
 mastery_events.3.desc: "The ability to mass-produce the written word would revolutionize the spread of information, and in many ways early modern society as a whole. The new art helped fuel the era of High Engineering by making detailed blueprints readily available throughout the known world through the new trading networks.\n\nNow that Printing has matured as a technique and spread throughout [institution_origin.GetContinentName], hundreds of thousands of copies of everything from religious and political pamphlets to scientific treatises and instructions on how to behave are circulating the continent. With print shops growing evermore commonplace, rulers have found it hard to contain the new technique, as the comparatively easy means of production makes it easy for censorship to be sidestepped by moving business across a border or even just changing the name on a title page."
 mastery_events.32.desc: "Rumors have reached us of far-away lands where the written word is mass-produced in huge and never before imagined numbers. According to these informants, this has reshaped their learned and political world entirely."
 mastery_events.3.option.a: "This changes everything..."
 mastery_events.3.tt: "§YEmbracing§! the §YPrinting Press§! Mastery will be vital for future advancements in §YTechnology§!."

 mastery_events.4.title: "Birth of Manufacturing"
 mastery_events.4.desc: "The effects of recent engineering breakthroughs has greatly affected the economic sector of many cities and towns across the continent. People have been able to produce more products with specialized machinery, but have been limited by city restrictions and the central authority of their country.\n\nBut by taking up residence outside of the city limits, merchant capitalists are able to bypass these ancient restrictive laws that inhibit mass production as well as pioneer new ways to increase production through the organization and specialization of labor in one place. Without the practice of World Trade, manufacturing would have never taken hold."
 mastery_events.42.desc: "Merchants are reporting an influx of greater and greater numbers of foreign goods into our markets. Their point of origin is unclear, but it is apparent that somewhere production of refined goods has greatly increased."
 mastery_events.4.option.a: "This changes everything..."
 mastery_events.4.tt: "§YEmbracing§! the §YManufacturing§! Mastery will be vital for future advancements in §YTechnology§!."

 mastery_events.5.title: "Era of Industrialization"
 mastery_events.5.desc: "The rapid pace of technological change is beginning to have a profound effect on the very organization of society. The invention of the steam engine, the use of coke in iron production and new, mechanized manufacturing equipment allow for unprecedented economies of scale, bringing about a massive increase in worker productivity. Further inventions are helping to greatly ease the transportation of large volumes of goods. With global trade as interconnected as never before, factories can both draw on raw materials from and sell the resulting manufactured goods to markets around the world, bringing in unimaginable riches for their owners.\n\nMeanwhile, the field of agriculture, new practices such as the use of enclosures have similarly increased productivity, meaning that fewer workers are needed to work the same area of land, leading many to abandon their homes and settle in the growing industrial cities. A new world is being born, one in which the ambitious and the rich shall dominate society as never before."
 mastery_events.52.desc: "Merchants are reporting massive influxes of cheap, foreign manufactured goods into our markets, as well as the same foreign merchants purchasing equally massive quantities of raw materials from us. Although their point of origin is unclear, these developments are already having a profound impact on the organization of our society."
