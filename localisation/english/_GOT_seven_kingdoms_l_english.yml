 GOT_SK_RANDOM.15.title: "Heir Lends an Ear"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.15.desc: "We have noticed that the heir apparent has grown closer to certain courtiers and nobles who are known affiliates of the competing factions at court. There's a great fear that [Root.Heir.GetName] has come to strongly sympathize with political enemies of the royal throne. We could attempt to stop these friendships from growing, but having powerful friends in court can be a good thing for our [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] when he assumes the throne."

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.16.desc: "Word has reached you that a truly exceptional essay has passed through the Citadel. It argues convincingly and in excellent literary style that it is folly to expect a country to be rich from increasing taxes. Our examiners describe this text as 'profoundly crafted' and there is no doubt that it will give rise to a new style for examination essays for years to come.\nThe meat of the essay itself, however, cannot be ignored. The argument that avoiding high taxes makes the people as a whole richer and therefore the kingdom itself richer is a classical wisdom it is easy to overlook."
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.16.option.a: "I sense a great future for this man."

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.18.desc: "A high ranking noble has earned himself a reputation for cruelty since taking to regularly flogging a particular servant of his, of whom he seems to have a particular distaste.

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.23.title: "Frontier Hero"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.23.desc: "Word has reached us from the frontier provinces of a young general from one of our most influential families. The young man has made a name for himself as an excellent warrior and a great leader. His success has also made his family grow ever more influential at court.\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] is growing more and more fearful of their influence in court politics."

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.24.title: "'Maesters by Purchase'"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.24.desc: "Many would give much to be able to attend the Citadel. To some rich families, this would be a way to ensure that their children acquire the social status that their wealth should entitle them to. It has therefore been the custom to, in times of need, reserve a number of spots at the Citadel for those that can pay.\nMost will never take advantage of the actual opportunity to study, however, as admission in itself is enough to secure higher social standing."
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.24.option.a: "Just a few additional reserved spots can surely do no harm?"

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.25.desc: "Advisers led by the Master of Ships have been very active in foreign diplomacy lately. [country_of_interest.GetName] in particular occupies the faction's attention. They believe opening up more channels for trade and cooperation would be beneficial for both of our countries. Some would rather argue that [country_of_interest.GetName] should submit to the authority of the Iron Throne.\nThe foreign ambassador has been summoned to the royal palace. What shall we tell him?"

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.27.title: "Royal Insults"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.27.desc: "Today the reception of foreign dignitaries and potentates to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ court, has caused a diplomatic blunder. Contrary to protocol a foreign diplomat failed to perform the customary bow before our representatives.

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.28.desc: "The armies from the Great Houses have amassed on the exercise field for inspection. Everywhere you look there is a forest of spears and swords, aiming in defiance at the heavens above. Several powerful nobles are present.

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.29.title: "Failures of the Citadel"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.29.desc: "As the research at the Citadel is refuted once again only a few hundreds of the thousands that participate will pass. This elite of experienced maesters will join the administration to rule the Seven Kingdoms in accordance with the traditional ideals.\nThe many that fail, however, have to find work elsewhere. Far from illiterate they are still carriers of the traditional ideals and education that their research requires. These are the doctors, teachers and scribes of the kingdom. Some might say they are as valuable as the erudite few who join the cadres in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]"

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.30.desc: "There are those who feel the Citadel are not in tune with what is good and proper research and that the ideal they promote is stale and old fashioned. Among those researching are alternative collections of research, which have begun circulating what is considered a more modern form. The head masters, however, are determined to keep promoting good taste and proper form.\nBy supporting the renewal faction we would bring a generation of new thinkers to the fore. This would likely come at the cost of the goodwill and loyalty of the old generation..."

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.31.desc: "[From.From.GetName] has fallen and the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty is now believed to be the new holders of the Iron Throne. We are expected to pick up the mantle of the King and bring the Westerosi people into a new era of prosperity and stability.\nIf we want to win over the remaining supporters of [From.From.GetName] rule we must start to build our own Royal bureaucracy and invest in a strong and durable state. On the other hand [Root.Monarch.GetName] worries that disloyal nobles will remain within any organization we inherit from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] predecessors."

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.32.desc: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle], your reign has ushered in a new era and as the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] complete their take-over the Seven Kingdoms will undoubtedly prosper for many years to come. Perhaps the time has come to look back to the [From.From.GetName] empire and start the compilation of their history.

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.35.desc: "A strong army has always been required to secure the Wall in the North.

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.36.title: "Pre-Andal Statuette"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.36.desc: "A rare statuette from the Pre-Andal era has been discovered during renovations of an old sept. The idea has crossed your mind that it might be clever to bestow the statuette upon a worthy subject to strengthen his loyalty to you, The Sovereign. Loyalties will doubtlessly change on account of such an impressive gift delivered directly from the Sovereign's own hand. Who shall we give it to?"

Apparently the men have had a hard time getting along for quite some time, and the insult was probably not entirely unprovoked.

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.45.title: "Rise of Militias"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.45.desc: "Our weakening grip over the kingdom and the increasingly popular notion that we are losing royal authority has given rise to a variety of militia movements around the country.

In the corner of your eye a black-clad man approaches you from behind.

 GOT_SK_RANDOM.50.title: "Disloyal Officials"
 GOT_SK_RANDOM.50.desc: "The Citadel is excellent for turning out well educated and thoroughly competent maesters, ready to face the various challenges of day to day rule and administration that the Seven Kingdoms possess.\nThat same education is, however, now making our administrators very weary of some of the measures we have been taking recently. Believing the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family to be acting without a just cause has made many officials unwilling to comply with our demand. At times it would seem royal authority doesn't stretch further than one can see from the palace walls."
