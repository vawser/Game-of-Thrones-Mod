 # Country Description
 string_start_the_targaryens: "It's been nearly two centuries after the dragonlord §YAegon the Conqueror§! subdued Six of the Seven Kingdoms in what's now known as §YAegon's Conquest§!. While the unsuccessful attempt at subjugating the Dornish people meant the continent wouldn't be fully united under their grip, there was no debate that §YHouse Targaryen§! was the undisputed master of mainland Westeros.\n\nHaving dealt with a major civil war only seventy years ago, House Targaryen has had a relatively long period of dynastic stability in their house. Though the birth of several bastard children theatens to shake the integrity of the house once more as the likelihood of a pretender uprising only increases tensions between the Targaryen royals.\n\nNow, in the year of §Y196 A.D.§!, the threat of civil war looms around the corner. Whispers of §YDaemon Blackfyre§!, a legitimized bastard son of the late King Aegon IV Targaryen, intent on claiming the crown of the Seven Kingdoms and marching upon King's Landing to seize the throne for himself are spreading throughout our court rapidly. Having been knighted by his late father and being gifted §Y'Blackfyre'§!, one of the Valyrian steel swords of House Targaryen, started talk that Daemon should be king, threatening the natural line of succession. While we don't know the validity of these rumors, such talks should not be disregarded so easily and we should prepare for the worst.\n\nAs the rightful §YKing of the Seven Kingdoms§! and the §YProtector of the Realm§!, it is our duty to ensure the security and continuing stability by eliminating all threats to the Crown even if the threat comes from within our own family."
 string_start_nights_watch: "The [Root.GovernmentName] of the §YNight's Watch§! has been around since its founding during the §YAge of Heroes§!, at the time when the §YOthers§! were pushed back far enough north. Having won a great victory at the §YBattle for the Dawn§!, the legendary King of Winter §YBran the Builder§! of House Stark constructed a massive ice barrier stretching across the northern border of the Seven Kingdoms to protect against invasions and the organization known as the Night's Watch was established to garrison the castles that were strategically positioned along the Wall.\n\nWith the apparent disappearance of the entities known as the §YOthers§!, the mission of the Watch soon shifted towards the fight against the §YFree Folk§! beyond the wall. Generations of elected §YLord Commanders§! would oversee defensive operations against the wildling raids in the north, and many so-called §YKings-Beyond-the-Wall§! would attempt to unite the free folk to ensure these raids would be successful.\n\nThough collaboration with §YWesterosi§! nobles has always never resulted in any permanent alliances, we have always been staunchly supported by the §YHouse Stark§! of §YWinterfell§!. Due to this long-standing partnership, it is tradition for the §YGreat House§! of §Y[TheNorthGreatHouse.GetIfHouseName]§! to provide assistance in our desparate times of need.\n\nNow the mission of the Night's Watch is a simple one: Protect the North as well as the rest of Westeros from the wildling menace and, if possible, eradicate them from the continent. And should the §YOthers§! ever return, be ready to lay down your life for the realms of men..."

 string_start_westeros_description: "The continent of Westeros is home to the disunited polity known as the §YSeven Kingdoms§!. House Targaryen established the kingdom during §YAegon's Conquest§! and has since then solidified their control over the entirety of the continent. Governing from the their seat in the §YCrownlands§!, the King of the Seven Kingdoms is empowered by all of the §YGreat Houses§! of Westeros who, in turn, protects them from both internal and external threats.\n\nDue to the decentralized nature of the kingdom, §YFeudatories§! are able to conduct diplomacy and wage war with each other without the interference of their overlords and the King except in extreme situations. In such cases, the King himself may demand an end to the hostilities or may join the fight on either side.\n\n[Root.westeros_sk_mechanic_description]To the far North, the §YFree Folk§! clans clash was the §YNight's Watch§! in a millennia long feud which many people have forgotten the root cause for. The wildlings, being primitive in nature, do not kneel to a superior lord in the same manner as the Westerosi lords do and, as such, are not bound by noble traditions. Some believe in the old myths of the §YWhite Walker§!, also regarded as 'The Others', who supposedly exist further North than the wildling clans. Due to their unnatural characteristics in these myths, a majority of the folk living on the continent don't believe them to be a credible threat."
