 adm_tech_cs_3_name: "Feudal Elite"
 adm_tech_cs_3_desc: "While there may be a King or elected Magister in charge of a whole nation, it's the fabric of the feudal hierarchy that maintains order and stability across the continents."
 
 adm_tech_cs_4_name: "National Ideas"

 adm_tech_cs_9_name: "The Scythe"
 adm_tech_cs_9_desc: "Although it has been in existence for a long time, the scythe somehow still isn't the most popular tool for harvesting crops. By encouraging peasants to use a scythe instead of a sickle we will improve the efficiency of our harvests."

 adm_tech_cs_12_name: "Scientific Experimentation"
 adm_tech_cs_12_desc: "While it is true that we stand on the shoulders of our ancestors it is high time that we start to learn about the world from our own, well documented observations.

 adm_tech_cs_13_name: "Military Administration"
 adm_tech_cs_13_desc: "By creating a permanent organization charged with taking care of the procuring and planning of Military supplies and by keeping more troops on the rolls even during wintertime or peacetime we will in the long run be able to field large armies more cheaply and be able to support these armies more efficiently while at war."
 
 adm_tech_cs_14_name: "Taxation Offices"
 adm_tech_cs_14_desc: "There are many people who demand to be given a role in the government, but in reality mostly want rewards without effort. A new interesting idea of absolutism is spreading, which is a system where we dispose of those parasites and govern alone."
 
 adm_tech_cs_15_name: "National Sovereignty"
 adm_tech_cs_15_desc: "States rather than individual rulers or supra-national groupings are the actors on the international arena and no state has the right to intervene in the internal affairs of another."
